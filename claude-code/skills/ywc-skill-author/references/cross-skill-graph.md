# Cross-Skill Graph

This document captures the dependency and cross-reference relationships among the 18 production ywc-* skills as of 2026-04. Use it to:

1. Decide whether a new skill needs `requires: [...]` and what to put there.
2. Decide what to write in the `Do not use for ... (use ywc-X)` portion of a new skill's description.
3. Detect overlap before creating a new skill (overlap usually means an existing skill should be extended instead).

Standalone / parallel skills (no requires):

- `ywc-security-audit` — runs against any code path; not pipeline-bound
- `ywc-ui-ux-review` — runs against running UI; not pipeline-bound
- `ywc-product-review` — runs against project state; not pipeline-bound
- `ywc-e2e-test-strategy` — runs after implementation; not pipeline-bound (init / audit / flow modes)
- `ywc-incident-postmortem` — runs reactively after production incidents; not part of dev pipeline
- `ywc-changelog-release-notes` — runs at release time; soft dependency on ywc-release-pr-list output
- `ywc-merge-dependabot` — independent of feature pipeline
- `ywc-project-scaffold` — pre-pipeline (used at project start)
- `ywc-project-docs` — independent documentation utility
- `ywc-skill-author` — meta-skill for authoring other skills

## Flag Propagation Patterns

When skill A delegates to skill B and both implement the same side effect (e.g., updating a document, running a check), the delegated call must include an explicit skip flag so the side effect does not run twice. This is the **flag propagation contract**.

### Canonical pattern

```
Caller (skill A) — performs side effect in its own Step X
   │
   │  delegates with --skip-<side-effect>
   ▼
Callee (skill B) — Step Y that performs the same side effect is no-op'd
```

The skip flag is named after the action being skipped, not the caller (e.g., `--skip-ubiquitous-update`, not `--skip-from-create-pr`). This keeps the contract semantic rather than positional — new callers can adopt the same flag without changing the callee.

### Documented production examples

| Caller → Callee | Skip flag | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `ywc-finish-branch` → `ywc-create-pr` | `--skip-post-ci-check` | `ywc-finish-branch` Step 4 runs its own CI + bot review check |
| `ywc-finish-branch` → `ywc-create-pr` | `--skip-ubiquitous-update` | `ywc-finish-branch` Step 1.5 already ran the UL update |
| `ywc-create-pr` → `ywc-commit` | `--skip-ubiquitous-update` | `ywc-create-pr` Step 0.5 already ran the UL update |

### Rules for adding a new propagated flag

1. **The callee defines the flag**, not the caller. The callee owns the side effect, so it owns the off-switch.
2. **Document the flag in the callee's `## Arguments` table**, with the caller listed as a known invoker.
3. **Document the propagation in both `claude-code/skills/CLAUDE.md`** (in a "Calling `<callee>` from Other Skills" subsection) and in the callee's README under `## Integration`.
4. **Add a Rationalization Defense row to the callee** for "the caller already did X, mine would duplicate" — this catches the regression where a future refactor of the caller forgets to pass the flag.
5. **The flag must be passed in every delegation hop**. If A → B → C and the side effect is owned by C, then A → B passes the flag AND B → C passes it. Inference across hops is unsafe because the intermediate skill may not know whether the upstream caller already ran the side effect.

### When to introduce flag propagation vs. a sub-skill split

If the side effect can plausibly be skipped by **any caller** of the callee (e.g., the side effect is a heavy network call), use flag propagation.

If the side effect is **only ever skipped** because a specific upstream skill ran it, consider extracting the side effect into a third skill that both A and B invoke conditionally. Flag propagation is right when the side effect is logically owned by the callee but contextually skipped.

## How to Use This Graph When Writing a New Skill

1. **Find the closest existing skill.** If your new skill's purpose is within ~80% of an existing one, **do not create a new skill** — extend the existing one. Splitting an over-similar pair causes activation collision.

2. **Identify upstream dependency.** If your skill relies on another ywc-* skill having run first (e.g., reading task directories, requiring a spec), declare `requires: [ywc-X]`. If the dependency is conventional but not strict, omit `requires:` and instead mention the upstream in `## Integration` body section.

3. **Identify potential collisions.** Look at the Cross-Reference Table for the closest 2-3 existing skills. Their description triggers tell you which natural-language phrases overlap with your new skill. Add `Do not use for ... (use ywc-X)` for each collision.

4. **Update this graph.** When adding a new skill, add it to:
   - The Dependency Graph (placement based on `requires:`)
   - The Cross-Reference Table (one row, listing each anti-trigger pointer)

## Spotting Overlap (Avoid Creating Duplicate Skills)

If the new skill matches one of these patterns, it is overlap with an existing skill — reconsider:

| New skill purpose | Already covered by |
|---|---|
| "Generate unit tests" | (separate from `ywc-gen-testcase`, which is for human verification testsheets) — but if the goal is test generation as part of code generation, use `ywc-code-gen`'s QA agent |
| "Lint check / typecheck before commit" | `ywc-create-pr` Step 5 (CI Check) |
| "Verify code matches spec" | `ywc-impl-review` Spec axis |
| "Find security vulnerabilities" | `ywc-security-audit` |
| "Decompose feature into tasks" | `ywc-task-generator` |
| "Run tasks in worktrees" | `ywc-parallel-executor` |
| "Stage selected files and commit" | `ywc-commit` |

When in doubt, propose the new skill to the user and ask whether to extend an existing one instead.

## Naming Conventions for New Skills

Pattern: `ywc-<verb-or-domain-noun>` — short, kebab-case, descriptive.

| Style | Examples (existing) | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| Verb-led | `ywc-create-pr`, `ywc-handle-pr-reviews`, `ywc-merge-dependabot` | Action-oriented skills |
| Domain noun + suffix | `ywc-impl-review`, `ywc-spec-validate`, `ywc-security-audit` | Review / audit skills |
| Compound noun | `ywc-task-generator`, `ywc-tech-research`, `ywc-gen-testcase` | Generator / produce-X skills |
| Executor pattern | `ywc-sequential-executor`, `ywc-parallel-executor` | Multi-task orchestration |

Avoid:

- Generic names like `ywc-helper`, `ywc-utility`
- Names ending in `-skill` (redundant)
- Names mentioning models or tools (`ywc-claude-X`, `ywc-gpt-X`)

## Last Updated
